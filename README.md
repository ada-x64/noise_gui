# `noise_gui`

A graphical user interface for [Noise-rs](https://github.com/Razaekel/noise-rs).

TODO:

- [ ] Add node implementations for each `NoiseFn`
- [ ] Allow saving the graph project to a file
- [ ] Allow zoom/pan on the noise preview images
- [ ] Allow image/data export
- [ ] Support wasm with online version
- [ ] Fix bugs

## Data model export

TBD: Once a graph has been completed you may export it to a file (RON?) and later reload the noise
graph and set named constants before evaluating points.
